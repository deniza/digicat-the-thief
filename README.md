# digicat-the-thief

You are a cat. A thief Cat. You steal diamonds. But diamonds are protected by other cats. You should avoid those cats. They say cats have 9 lives. They are wrong. You have 3. Is there an end? Not sure, but there is maybe in level 33. I am experimenting something. Thanks for playing.
